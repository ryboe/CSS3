VERSION 2.1.18 CHANGES

Fix the nasty "25000 context sanity limit" bug that was driving people nuts.
Unfortunately, this fix means that when editing CSS in HTML (or an HTML-like
language), about ~150 lesser-used CSS properties will not be highlighted. This
is only when editing CSS inside HTML. Pure CSS files are unaffected and will
work like always.

Many of the properties I cut out won't be missed, but some will. If you see a
CSS property in your HTML that isn't highlighted, and you think it should be,
please open an issue and I'll try to add it back in.

Thanks, and sorry for not getting to this bug sooner! I would like to point out
that this is an open-source project. PRs are always welcome here:
