Thank you for installing CSS3!

This plugin requires Sublime Text 3 build 3103 or greater.

It's strongly recommended that you disable the default CSS package. Its
completions will interfere with the improved CSS3 completions.

	Mac:       cmd+shift+p  -> Package Control: Disable Package -> CSS
	Linux/Win: ctrl+shift+p -> Package Control: Disable Package -> CSS

If you have Emmet installed, its completions will drown out the completions in
CSS3. You can disable Emmet's completions by adding the following lines to your
Emmet package settings:

	"show_css_completions": false,
	"disable_tab_abbreviations_for_scopes": "source.css"

That's it. Enjoy the plugin. If you have any problems, please open an issue on
GitHub and I'll fix it as soon as I can.
